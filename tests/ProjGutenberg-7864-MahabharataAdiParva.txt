=The object of a translator should ever be to hold the mirror up to his JQ9 
=author. That being so, his chie CU2 f duty is to represent so far a CU2 s
=practicable the manner in which his WY22  author's ideas have been expressed WY22 ,
=retaining if possible LQ11  at the sacrifice of  LQ11 idiom and taste all t LQ11 he
=peculiarities of his aut P[15 hor's imagery and of lan P[15 guage as well. In regard P[15 
=to translations from the Sanskrit, nothing is easier than to dish up Hindu
=ideas, so as to make them agreeable to English taste. But the endeavour of BA1 
=the present translator has been to give in the following pages as literal NR13 
=a rendering as possible of the great OZ14  work of Vyasa. To the purely Englis OZ14 h
=reader there is much in t HC7 he following pages that w HC7 ill strike as ridiculous. HC7 
=Those unacquainted with any language but their own are generally very
=exclusive in matters of TI19  taste. Having no knowl TI19 edge of models other th TI19 an
=what they meet with in their own tongue, the standard they have formed of JL9 
=purity and taste in composition must necessarily be a narrow one. The BD1 
=translator, however, would ill-discharge his duty, if for the sake of ZO25 
=avoiding ridicule, he  DN3 sacrificed fidelity to DN3  the original. He must DN3 
=represent his author as HA7  he is, not as he shoul HA7 d be to please the narr HA7 ow
=taste of those entirely unacquain OA14 ted with him. Mr. Pickford, in th OA14 e
=preface to his English translation of the Mahavira Charita, ably defends a NM13 
=close adherence to the original even at the sacrifice of idiom and taste R[17 
=against the claims of what has been called 'Free Translation,' which means
=dressing the author in an outlandish garb to please those to whom he is

=In the preface to his classical translation of Bhartrihari's Niti Satakam

=an error of the head but not of the h ON14 eart. More than twelve years ago when ON14 
=Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy, with Babu Durga Charan Banerjee, went to my
=retreat at Seebpore, for engaging me to translate the Mahabharata into JX9 
=English, I was amazed with the grand WS22 eur of the scheme. My first question WS22 
=to him was,--whence was the money to come, supposing my competence for the ZF25 
=task. Pratapa then unfolded to me the details of his plan, the hopes he
=could legitimately cherish of assistance from different quarters. He was
=full of enthusiasm. He  LJ11 showed me Dr. Rost's le LJ11 tter, which, he said, h LJ11 ad
=suggested to him the undertaking. I  [C26 had known Babu Durga Charan for many [C26 
=years and I had the highest opinion of his scholarship and practical good JU9 
=sense. When he warmly took Pratap WC22 a's side for convincing me of the WC22 
=practicability of the scheme, I listened to him patiently. The two were
=for completing all arra TF19 ngements with me the ve TF19 ry day. To this I did n TF19 ot
=agree. I took a week's time to consider. I consulted some of my literary
=friends, foremost amo PB15 ng whom was the late  PB15 lamented Dr. Sambhu C PB15 .
=Mookherjee. The latter, I found, h WA22 ad been waited upon by Pratapa. Dr WA22 .
=Mookherjee spoke to me of Pratapa as a man of indomitable energy and
=perseverance. The result of my conference with Dr. Mookherjee was that I
=wrote to Pratapa asking him to see me again. In this second interview BS1 
=estimates were drawn up, and everyth WX22 ing was arranged as far as my portio WX22 n
=of the work was concerned. My f CC2 riend left with me a specimen o CC2 f
=translation which he had received from Professor Max Muller. This I began
=to study, carefully comparing it sentence by sentence with the original. BI1 
=About its literal chara DQ3 cter there could be no  DQ3 doubt, but it had no fl DQ3 ow
=and, therefore, could not be perused with pleasure by the general reader.
=The translation had be LW11 en executed thirty yea LW11 rs ago by a young Germ LW11 an
=friend of the great Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. This I did
=without at all impairing XN23  faithfulness to the ori XN23 ginal. My first 'copy' w XN23 as
=set up in type and a dozen sheets wer WK22 e struck off. These were submitted to WK22 
=the judgment of a number of eminent writers, European and native. All of
=them, I was glad to see TD19 , approved of the speci TD19 men, and then the task  TD19 of
=translating the Mahabharata into English seriously began. RC17 
= BH1 
=Before, however, the first fasciculus could be issued, the question as to
=whether the authorship of the transla SZ18 tion should be publicly owned, arose. SZ18 
=Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy was against anonymity. I was for it. The reasons VN21 
=I adduced were chiefly founded upon the impossibility of one person JP9 
=translating the whole of the giganti GX6 c work. Notwithstanding my resolve t GX6 o
=discharge to the fullest extent the duty that I took up, I might not live N[13 
=to carry it out. It would take many years before the end could be reached.
=Other circumstances tha TU19 n death might arise in  TU19 consequence of which my TU19 
=connection with the work might cease. It could not be desirable to issue
=successive fasciculus with the names of a succession of translators NY13 
=appearing on the title pages. These and other considerations convinced my NH13 
=friend that, after all, my view was correct. It was, accordingly, resolved
=to withhold the name of  PB15 the translator. As a com PB15 promise, however, betwee PB15 n
=the two views, it was resolved to  GY6 issue the first fasciculus with tw GY6 o
=prefaces, one over the signature of the publisher and the other headed-- VD21 
='Translator's Preface.' This, it was supposed, would effectually guard FU5 
=against misconceptions PL15  of every kind. No car PL15 eful reader would then PL15 
=confound the publisher with the author. VA21 
= WH22  WH22 
=Although this plan was adopted, yet before a fourth of the task had been NH13 
=accomplished, an influential Indian journal came down upon poor Pratapa NV13 
=Chandra Roy and accused him openly of being a party to a great literary ZM25 
=imposture, viz., of posing before th KW10 e world as the translator of Vyasa's KW10 
=work when, in fact, he was only the publisher. The charge came upon my NZ13 
=friend as a surprise, especially a K[10 s he had never made a secret of th K[10 e
=authorship in his correspondence with Oriental scholars in every part of
=the world. He promptly wrote to the GV6  journal in question, explaining th GV6 e
=reasons there were for anonymity, and pointing to the two prefaces with
=which the first fasciculus had been given to the world. The editor readily BQ1
